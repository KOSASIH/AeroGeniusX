This code defines a function `calculate_aerodynamic_forces` that takes inputs such as airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. It then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The function uses the given inputs and predefined constants to perform the necessary calculations. It then generates a markdown output that presents a detailed analysis of the aerodynamic forces and moments.

In the example usage, the function is called with sample values for airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. The resulting aerodynamic analysis is printed to the console.

To optimize the shape of an aircraft wing for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, we can use an optimization algorithm such as the genetic algorithm. Here's an example code that demonstrates the process:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    # Perform calculations to determine lift and drag
    lift = ...
    drag = ...
    return lift, drag

def evaluate_fitness(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    lift, drag = calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude)
    return lift / drag

def optimize_wing_shape(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations):
    best_fitness = -np.inf
    best_wing_shape = None

    for _ in range(generations):
        population = np.random.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(population_size, len(wing_geometry)))
        fitness_values = []

        for individual in population:
            wing_shape = wing_geometry + individual
            fitness = evaluate_fitness(wing_shape, airspeed, altitude)
            fitness_values.append(fitness)

            if fitness > best_fitness:
                best_fitness = fitness
                best_wing_shape = wing_shape

        # Perform selection, crossover, and mutation operations

    return best_wing_shape, best_fitness

# Define initial wing geometry
initial_wing_geometry = ...

# Define inputs
airspeed = ...
altitude = ...

# Set optimization parameters
population_size = ...
generations = ...

# Optimize wing shape
optimized_wing_shape, optimized_l_d_ratio = optimize_wing_shape(initial_wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations)

# Output markdown code
print("## Optimized Wing Shape")
print("```")
print(f"Wing Geometry: {optimized_wing_shape}")
print(f"Lift-to-Drag Ratio: {optimized_l_d_ratio}")
print("```")
```

Please note that this code is just a template and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and the optimization algorithm you choose to implement.

```

This code defines a function `analyze_fuselage` that takes inputs such as fuselage geometry, material properties, and applied loads. It performs a comprehensive analysis of the stress distribution, deformation, and safety factors in the fuselage structure.

The function calculates the axial stress and bending stress in the fuselage based on the applied loads, and then determines the maximum stress. It also calculates the safety factor by dividing the yield strength of the material by the maximum stress. Additionally, it calculates the deformation of the fuselage under the applied bending moment.

The function outputs the analysis results in a markdown format, including the fuselage geometry parameters, material properties, applied loads, axial stress, bending stress, maximum stress, safety factor, and deformation.

An example usage is provided at the end of the code, demonstrating how to pass the input parameters to the `analyze_fuselage` function. Feel free to modify the input values to suit your specific analysis requirements.

```

This code provides a framework for simulating the aerodynamic behavior of a new aircraft wing design. It takes inputs such as wing geometry (wing area, span, and chord), airspeed, and altitude. The code then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the wing, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The specific calculations for lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and pitching moment coefficient are left for you to implement based on your specific aerodynamic models and data. You can replace the placeholder functions `calculate_lift_coefficient`, `calculate_drag_coefficient`, and `calculate_pitching_moment_coefficient` with your own implementations.

The code also includes a placeholder function `get_air_density` to calculate air density based on altitude. You should implement your own air density model or use existing models to calculate the air density at a given altitude.

Finally, the code outputs the calculated lift force, drag force, and pitching moment in Newtons and Newton-meters, respectively, in markdown format.

This code defines a function `calculate_weight` that takes inputs such as fuselage geometry, material properties, and safety factors, and returns markdown code presenting the optimized fuselage shape parameters and the corresponding weight. The optimization problem aims to minimize the weight of the fuselage while maintaining structural integrity. The code uses the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to perform the optimization, with the objective function being the weight of the fuselage and the constraint function ensuring that the critical buckling load is greater than the maximum allowable load. The code also includes input parameters for the fuselage geometry, material properties, and safety factors, which can be adjusted according to specific requirements.
