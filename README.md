# Example usage

This code defines a function `calculate_aerodynamic_forces` that takes inputs such as airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. It then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The function uses the given inputs and predefined constants to perform the necessary calculations. It then generates a markdown output that presents a detailed analysis of the aerodynamic forces and moments.

In the example usage, the function is called with sample values for airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. The resulting aerodynamic analysis is printed to the console.

To optimize the shape of an aircraft wing for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, we can use an optimization algorithm such as the genetic algorithm. Here's an example code that demonstrates the process:

## Calculate Lift Drag 

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    # Perform calculations to determine lift and drag
    lift = ...
    drag = ...
    return lift, drag

def evaluate_fitness(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    lift, drag = calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude)
    return lift / drag

def optimize_wing_shape(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations):
    best_fitness = -np.inf
    best_wing_shape = None

    for _ in range(generations):
        population = np.random.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(population_size, len(wing_geometry)))
        fitness_values = []

        for individual in population:
            wing_shape = wing_geometry + individual
            fitness = evaluate_fitness(wing_shape, airspeed, altitude)
            fitness_values.append(fitness)

            if fitness > best_fitness:
                best_fitness = fitness
                best_wing_shape = wing_shape

        # Perform selection, crossover, and mutation operations

    return best_wing_shape, best_fitness

# Define initial wing geometry
initial_wing_geometry = ...

# Define inputs
airspeed = ...
altitude = ...

# Set optimization parameters
population_size = ...
generations = ...

# Optimize wing shape
optimized_wing_shape, optimized_l_d_ratio = optimize_wing_shape(initial_wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations)

# Output markdown code
print("## Optimized Wing Shape")
print("```")
print(f"Wing Geometry: {optimized_wing_shape}")
print(f"Lift-to-Drag Ratio: {optimized_l_d_ratio}")
print("```")
```

Please note that this code is just a template and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and the optimization algorithm you choose to implement.

```python

def analyze_fuselage(fuselage_geometry, material_properties, applied_loads):
    # Extract fuselage geometry parameters

    # Calculate axial stress
    axial_stress = axial_load / area

    # Calculate bending stress
    bending_stress = bending_moment * (diameter / 2) / moment_of_area

    # Calculate maximum stress
    maximum_stress = max(abs(axial_stress), abs(bending_stress))

    # Calculate safety factor
    safety_factor = yield_strength / maximum_stress

    # Calculate deformation

    'axial_load': 50000,
    'bending_moment': 1000000
}

analyze_fuselage(fuselage_geometry, material_properties, applied_loads)
```

This code defines a function `analyze_fuselage` that takes inputs such as fuselage geometry, material properties, and applied loads. It performs a comprehensive analysis of the stress distribution, deformation, and safety factors in the fuselage structure.

The function calculates the axial stress and bending stress in the fuselage based on the applied loads, and then determines the maximum stress. It also calculates the safety factor by dividing the yield strength of the material by the maximum stress. Additionally, it calculates the deformation of the fuselage under the applied bending moment.

The function outputs the analysis results in a markdown format, including the fuselage geometry parameters, material properties, applied loads, axial stress, bending stress, maximum stress, safety factor, and deformation.

An example usage is provided at the end of the code, demonstrating how to pass the input parameters to the `analyze_fuselage` function. Feel free to modify the input values to suit your specific analysis requirements.

    return lift_force, drag_force, pitching_moment

def get_air_density(altitude):

# Output markdown code
print(f"Lift Force: {lift_force} N")
print(f"Drag Force: {drag_force} N")
print(f"Pitching Moment: {pitching_moment} Nm")
```

This code provides a framework for simulating the aerodynamic behavior of a new aircraft wing design. It takes inputs such as wing geometry (wing area, span, and chord), airspeed, and altitude. The code then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the wing, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The specific calculations for lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and pitching moment coefficient are left for you to implement based on your specific aerodynamic models and data. You can replace the placeholder functions `calculate_lift_coefficient`, `calculate_drag_coefficient`, and `calculate_pitching_moment_coefficient` with your own implementations.

The code also includes a placeholder function `get_air_density` to calculate air density based on altitude. You should implement your own air density model or use existing models to calculate the air density at a given altitude.

Finally, the code outputs the calculated lift force, drag force, and pitching moment in Newtons and Newton-meters, respectively, in markdown format.

The code above calculates the temperature distribution in an aircraft's thermal protection system. It takes inputs such as thermal properties of the materials, heat transfer mechanisms, and external heat flux.

The resulting temperature distribution is then plotted using a 3D scatter plot.

The above code defines a function `calculate_aerodynamic_forces` that takes inputs such as `tail_geometry`, `aircraft_dynamics`, and `flight_conditions`. It performs aerodynamic calculations to determine the lift, drag, and pitching moment based on the tail geometry, aircraft dynamics, and flight conditions.

The code then defines an objective function and constraint function for the optimization process using the `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. The objective function aims to maximize the lift, while the constraint function ensures that the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than or equal to 10 and the pitching moment is less than or equal to 0.

The initial guess for the tail geometry is set, and the optimization is performed using the `minimize` function. The optimized tail shape parameters are extracted from the optimization result, and the stability and maneuverability characteristics are calculated based on the optimized tail geometry.

Finally, the optimized tail shape parameters and the corresponding stability and maneuverability characteristics are printed as the output.

```

In the code above, the `calculate_stability_manoeuvrability` function takes inputs such as `tail_geometry`, `aircraft_dynamics`, and `flight_conditions` to optimize the shape of an aircraft tail for improved stability and maneuverability. The function uses the `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to find the optimal tail shape parameters that minimize the negative sum of stability and manoeuvrability. The optimized tail shape parameters and corresponding stability and manoeuvrability characteristics are then returned. 

You would need to provide the specific implementation details for calculating stability, manoeuvrability, tail geometry, aircraft dynamics, and flight conditions based on your requirements and available data.

The code above provides a framework for optimizing the shape of an aircraft tail for improved stability and maneuverability. It defines functions to update the tail geometry, calculate stability and maneuverability, and perform the optimization using the SciPy library's `minimize` function with the SLSQP method.

The `calculate_stability_and_maneuverability` function takes these inputs and returns a markdown output that includes the optimized tail shape parameters, stability, and maneuverability characteristics.

Note that the placeholder values for stability and maneuverability calculations need to be replaced with the actual calculations based on the given tail geometry, aircraft dynamics, and flight conditions.
