This code defines a function `calculate_aerodynamic_forces` that takes inputs such as airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. It then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The function uses the given inputs and predefined constants to perform the necessary calculations. It then generates a markdown output that presents a detailed analysis of the aerodynamic forces and moments.

In the example usage, the function is called with sample values for airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. The resulting aerodynamic analysis is printed to the console.

To optimize the shape of an aircraft wing for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, we can use an optimization algorithm such as the genetic algorithm. Here's an example code that demonstrates the process:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    # Perform calculations to determine lift and drag
    lift = ...
    drag = ...
    return lift, drag

def evaluate_fitness(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    lift, drag = calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude)
    return lift / drag

def optimize_wing_shape(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations):
    best_fitness = -np.inf
    best_wing_shape = None

    for _ in range(generations):
        population = np.random.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(population_size, len(wing_geometry)))
        fitness_values = []

        for individual in population:
            wing_shape = wing_geometry + individual
            fitness = evaluate_fitness(wing_shape, airspeed, altitude)
            fitness_values.append(fitness)

            if fitness > best_fitness:
                best_fitness = fitness
                best_wing_shape = wing_shape

        # Perform selection, crossover, and mutation operations

    return best_wing_shape, best_fitness

# Define initial wing geometry
initial_wing_geometry = ...

# Define inputs
airspeed = ...
altitude = ...

# Set optimization parameters
population_size = ...
generations = ...

# Optimize wing shape
optimized_wing_shape, optimized_l_d_ratio = optimize_wing_shape(initial_wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations)

# Output markdown code
print("## Optimized Wing Shape")
print("```")
print(f"Wing Geometry: {optimized_wing_shape}")
print(f"Lift-to-Drag Ratio: {optimized_l_d_ratio}")
print("```")
```

Please note that this code is just a template and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and the optimization algorithm you choose to implement.
