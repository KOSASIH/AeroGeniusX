This code defines a function `calculate_aerodynamic_forces` that takes inputs such as airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. It then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The function uses the given inputs and predefined constants to perform the necessary calculations. It then generates a markdown output that presents a detailed analysis of the aerodynamic forces and moments.

In the example usage, the function is called with sample values for airspeed, altitude, and aircraft configuration. The resulting aerodynamic analysis is printed to the console.

To optimize the shape of an aircraft wing for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, we can use an optimization algorithm such as the genetic algorithm. Here's an example code that demonstrates the process:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    # Perform calculations to determine lift and drag
    lift = ...
    drag = ...
    return lift, drag

def evaluate_fitness(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude):
    lift, drag = calculate_lift_drag(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude)
    return lift / drag

def optimize_wing_shape(wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations):
    best_fitness = -np.inf
    best_wing_shape = None

    for _ in range(generations):
        population = np.random.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=(population_size, len(wing_geometry)))
        fitness_values = []

        for individual in population:
            wing_shape = wing_geometry + individual
            fitness = evaluate_fitness(wing_shape, airspeed, altitude)
            fitness_values.append(fitness)

            if fitness > best_fitness:
                best_fitness = fitness
                best_wing_shape = wing_shape

        # Perform selection, crossover, and mutation operations

    return best_wing_shape, best_fitness

# Define initial wing geometry
initial_wing_geometry = ...

# Define inputs
airspeed = ...
altitude = ...

# Set optimization parameters
population_size = ...
generations = ...

# Optimize wing shape
optimized_wing_shape, optimized_l_d_ratio = optimize_wing_shape(initial_wing_geometry, airspeed, altitude, population_size, generations)

# Output markdown code
print("## Optimized Wing Shape")
print("```")
print(f"Wing Geometry: {optimized_wing_shape}")
print(f"Lift-to-Drag Ratio: {optimized_l_d_ratio}")
print("```")
```

Please note that this code is just a template and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and the optimization algorithm you choose to implement.

analyze_fuselage(fuselage_geometry, material_properties, applied_loads)
```

This code defines a function `analyze_fuselage` that takes inputs such as fuselage geometry, material properties, and applied loads. It performs a comprehensive analysis of the stress distribution, deformation, and safety factors in the fuselage structure.

The function calculates the axial stress and bending stress in the fuselage based on the applied loads, and then determines the maximum stress. It also calculates the safety factor by dividing the yield strength of the material by the maximum stress. Additionally, it calculates the deformation of the fuselage under the applied bending moment.

The function outputs the analysis results in a markdown format, including the fuselage geometry parameters, material properties, applied loads, axial stress, bending stress, maximum stress, safety factor, and deformation.

An example usage is provided at the end of the code, demonstrating how to pass the input parameters to the `analyze_fuselage` function. Feel free to modify the input values to suit your specific analysis requirements.

```

This code provides a framework for simulating the aerodynamic behavior of a new aircraft wing design. It takes inputs such as wing geometry (wing area, span, and chord), airspeed, and altitude. The code then calculates the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the wing, including lift force, drag force, and pitching moment.

The specific calculations for lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and pitching moment coefficient are left for you to implement based on your specific aerodynamic models and data. You can replace the placeholder functions `calculate_lift_coefficient`, `calculate_drag_coefficient`, and `calculate_pitching_moment_coefficient` with your own implementations.

The code also includes a placeholder function `get_air_density` to calculate air density based on altitude. You should implement your own air density model or use existing models to calculate the air density at a given altitude.

Finally, the code outputs the calculated lift force, drag force, and pitching moment in Newtons and Newton-meters, respectively, in markdown format.

This code defines a function `calculate_weight` that takes inputs such as fuselage geometry, material properties, and safety factors, and returns markdown code presenting the optimized fuselage shape parameters and the corresponding weight. The optimization problem aims to minimize the weight of the fuselage while maintaining structural integrity. The code uses the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to perform the optimization, with the objective function being the weight of the fuselage and the constraint function ensuring that the critical buckling load is greater than the maximum allowable load. The code also includes input parameters for the fuselage geometry, material properties, and safety factors, which can be adjusted according to specific requirements.

The above code defines a function `calculate_stability_and_maneuverability` that takes inputs such as `tail_geometry`, `aircraft_dynamics`, and `flight_conditions`. It uses the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to optimize the tail shape parameters based on the provided objective function. The `update_tail_geometry` function updates the tail geometry with the optimized parameters. The `calculate_stability` and `calculate_maneuverability` functions calculate the stability and maneuverability characteristics based on the updated tail geometry, aircraft dynamics, and flight conditions. Finally, the code generates the markdown output with the optimized tail shape parameters, stability characteristics, and maneuverability characteristics.

The code above calculates the temperature distribution in an aircraft's thermal protection system. It takes inputs such as thermal properties of the materials, heat transfer mechanisms, and external heat flux. The code uses a finite difference method to discretize the structure into divisions and iteratively calculates the temperature change in each division based on the heat transfer mechanisms. The resulting temperature distribution is then plotted using a 3D scatter plot.

The above code defines several functions to calculate the thrust, fuel consumption, and efficiency of a propulsion system based on the given engine characteristics, airspeed, and altitude. The `simulate_propulsion_system` function takes these inputs and uses the helper functions to calculate the required values. Finally, it formats the results into a markdown output string.

You can customize the `engine_power`, `engine_efficiency`, `airspeed`, and `altitude` variables to simulate different propulsion system scenarios. The markdown output will provide detailed analysis of the thrust, fuel consumption, and efficiency of the propulsion system under the given conditions.

```

The above code defines a function `calculate_aerodynamic_forces` that takes inputs such as `tail_geometry`, `aircraft_dynamics`, and `flight_conditions`. It performs aerodynamic calculations to determine the lift, drag, and pitching moment based on the tail geometry, aircraft dynamics, and flight conditions.

The code then defines an objective function and constraint function for the optimization process using the `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. The objective function aims to maximize the lift, while the constraint function ensures that the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than or equal to 10 and the pitching moment is less than or equal to 0.

The initial guess for the tail geometry is set, and the optimization is performed using the `minimize` function. The optimized tail shape parameters are extracted from the optimization result, and the stability and maneuverability characteristics are calculated based on the optimized tail geometry.

Finally, the optimized tail shape parameters and the corresponding stability and maneuverability characteristics are printed as the output.
