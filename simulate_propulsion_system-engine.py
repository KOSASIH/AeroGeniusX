    ## Propulsion System Analysis

    ### Inputs:
    - Engine Characteristics:
        - Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption: {thrust_specific_fuel_consumption} kg/N/h
        - Maximum Thrust: {max_thrust} N
    - Airspeed: {airspeed} m/s
    - Altitude: {altitude} m

    ### Results:
    - Thrust: {thrust} N
    - Fuel Consumption: {fuel_consumption} kg/h
    - Efficiency: {efficiency} N/(kg/s)

```

To use the `simulate_propulsion_system` function, you need to provide the engine characteristics, airspeed, and altitude as inputs. The function will then calculate the thrust, fuel consumption, and efficiency of the propulsion system. The results will be formatted as markdown code for easy presentation.

Note: This code assumes a standard atmosphere model for altitude calculations. Adjustments may be required for specific cases.
